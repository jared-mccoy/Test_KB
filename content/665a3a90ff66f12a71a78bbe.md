**Marion Robert Morrison**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne#cite_note-1)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne#cite_note-3) (May 26, 1907 – June 11, 1979), professionally known as **John Wayne** and nicknamed "**the Duke**", was an American actor who became a [popular icon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_icon "Popular icon") through his starring roles in films which were produced during [Hollywood's Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood%27s_Golden_Age "Hollywood's Golden Age"), especially in [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_film "Western film") and [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_film "War film") movies. His career flourished from the [silent era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_era "Silent era") of the 1920s through the [American New Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_New_Wave "American New Wave"), as he appeared in a total of 179 film and television productions. He was among the top box-office draws for three decades[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne#cite_note-numbers-4)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne#cite_note-5) and appeared with many other important Hollywood stars of his era. In 1999, the [American Film Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute "American Film Institute") selected Wayne as one of the [greatest male stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Stars "AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars") of classic American cinema.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne#cite_note-6)
