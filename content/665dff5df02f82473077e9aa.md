I was on [[Long Island]] and somewhere near the [[Great South Bay]] by the looks of it and I was waiting in the tall dune grass for a helicopter to arrive with the pilot (who I did not know) and [[Dan Stein ]](of all God's cretins!). The pilot was going to switch with whoever was flying.

The chopper arrives and who should it be flying but[[ Hillary Rodham Clinton]]. She was the one we were expecting (evidently) and she was having a good laugh at the surprise on our faces. 

She takes us up across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] toward [[New Jersey]] and all we can see across the entire horizon is gigantic cat 5+ [[tornadoes]] just absolutely demolishing the mainland, the whole time she's beaming laughing looking at us like : 'ain't it something, boys?'.
